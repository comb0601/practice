# CRTP and Advanced Templates - Code Examples

This directory contains 25 complete C++ programs demonstrating CRTP and Advanced Templates concepts.

## Overview

Lesson 30 focuses on crtp and advanced templates, covering essential C++ programming concepts and best practices.

## Compilation

All files can be compiled independently using:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_name
```

For files using threading:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_name -pthread
```

## Execution

After compilation, run the executable:
```bash
./output_name
```
