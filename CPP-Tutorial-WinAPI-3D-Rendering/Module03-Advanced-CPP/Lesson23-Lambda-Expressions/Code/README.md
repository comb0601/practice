# Lambda Expressions - Code Examples

This directory contains 18 complete C++ programs demonstrating Lambda Expressions concepts.

## Overview

Lesson 23 focuses on lambda expressions, covering essential C++ programming concepts and best practices.

## Compilation

All files can be compiled independently using:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_name
```

For files using threading:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_name -pthread
```

## Execution

After compilation, run the executable:
```bash
./output_name
```

## Topics Covered

This lesson covers:
- Core concepts of lambda expressions
- Practical implementation examples
- Best practices and common patterns
- Real-world usage scenarios

## Learning Objectives

After studying these examples, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of lambda expressions
- Be able to implement these concepts in your own projects
- Recognize when and how to apply these techniques
- Write more efficient and maintainable C++ code

## File Organization

Each file is numbered sequentially and focuses on a specific aspect of the lesson topic. Files are designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Can be compiled and run independently
- **Well-commented**: Detailed explanations of key concepts
- **Practical**: Demonstrates real-world usage patterns
