## Learning Path

1. Start with `01_HelloWorld.cpp` - Understand the basics
2. Move to `02_EnhancedHelloWorld.cpp` - Multiple outputs
3. Try `03_EscapeSequences.cpp` - Special characters
4. Read `04_Comments.cpp` - Learn to document code
5. Have fun with `05_ASCIIArt.cpp` - Practice formatting
6. Study `09_ProgramStructure.cpp` - Deep dive into structure
7. Learn from `10_CommonErrors.cpp` - Avoid mistakes

## Exercises

After running all programs, try these:

1. **Modify**: Change 07_PersonalInfo.cpp with your own information
2. **Create**: Make your own ASCII art in a new file
3. **Debug**: Uncomment errors in 10_CommonErrors.cpp one at a time and fix them
4. **Combine**: Create a program that uses multiple concepts from different examples
5. **Invent**: Write a program that displays your favorite quote or poem

## Tips for Success

- **Compile often**: Don't write too much code before compiling
- **Read error messages**: They tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Experiment**: Change values and see what happens
- **Comment your code**: Practice explaining what your code does
- **Have fun**: Programming is creative!

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these examples, move on to Lesson 02 where you'll learn about:
- Variables and data types
- User input with `std::cin`
- Arithmetic operations
- Type conversions
