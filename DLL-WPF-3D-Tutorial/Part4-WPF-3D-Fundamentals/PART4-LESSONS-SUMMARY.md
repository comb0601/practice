# Part 4: WPF 3D Fundamentals - Lessons 16-20

Master WPF's 3D graphics capabilities for building interactive 3D applications.

## Lessons in This Part

### ✅ Lesson 16: WPF 3D Overview (COMPLETE)
- WPF 3D architecture and rendering pipeline
- Viewport3D and coordinate systems
- Cameras, lights, and materials overview
- Creating your first 3D scene
- XAML vs code-behind for 3D

### Lesson 17: 3D Geometry Basics
- MeshGeometry3D in depth
- Vertices, indices, and triangles
- Normal vectors for lighting
- Texture coordinates (UV mapping)
- Creating primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder)
- Mesh optimization techniques

### Lesson 18: Materials and Lighting
- Material types: Diffuse, Specular, Emissive
- Light types: Directional, Point, Spot, Ambient
- Combining materials (MaterialGroup)
- Textures and ImageBrush
- Transparency and opacity
- Practical lighting setups

### Lesson 19: Cameras and Transformations
- PerspectiveCamera vs OrthographicCamera
- Camera positioning and orientation
- LookDirection and UpDirection
- Transform types: Translate, Rotate, Scale
- Transform groups and hierarchies
- Matrix transformations
- World/View/Projection matrices

### Lesson 20: Animation and Interaction
- Storyboard animations in XAML
- Animating transforms (rotation, position, scale)
- Camera animations and fly-throughs
- Mouse interaction (orbit, pan, zoom)
- Hit testing in 3D space
- Interactive object selection
- Event handling in 3D

## Complete 3D Scene Example

By the end of this part, you'll build:
- Interactive 3D model viewer
- Orbit camera controls
- Multiple light sources
- Textured materials
- Animated objects
- Click-to-select functionality

## Prerequisites

- Completed Part 1 and Part 2
- Basic WPF knowledge (XAML, data binding)
- Understanding of 3D concepts (helpful)

## Tools Needed

- Visual Studio
- .NET Framework 4.7.2+ or .NET 6+
- Optional: Blender for creating 3D models
