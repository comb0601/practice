# Lesson 5.3: Collision Detection

## Overview
Implement ROI intersection and overlap detection algorithms.

## Learning Objectives
- Detect AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) intersections
- Calculate overlap volumes
- Highlight intersecting ROIs
- Prevent ROI overlaps (optional constraint)

## Status
**Empty Lesson** - To be implemented

## Implementation Notes
See Module05-ROI-Advanced/README.md for detailed specifications.
