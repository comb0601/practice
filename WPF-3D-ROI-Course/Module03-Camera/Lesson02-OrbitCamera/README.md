# Lesson 3.2: Orbit Camera

## Overview
Implement a mouse-controlled orbit camera using spherical coordinates for intuitive 3D navigation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand spherical coordinate system (theta, phi, radius)
- Implement mouse drag to rotate camera
- Calculate camera position from spherical coordinates
- Handle camera constraints and limits

## Status
**Empty Lesson** - To be implemented

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - This is essential for all future ROI manipulation lessons.

## Implementation Notes
See Module03-Camera/README.md for detailed specifications.
