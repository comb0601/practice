# Lesson 46: Constexpr

## Duration
3 hours

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand core concepts of constexpr
- Implement practical solutions using constexpr
- Apply best practices and design patterns
- Debug and optimize code effectively
- Use modern C++ features appropriately

## Introduction

This lesson covers constexpr, an essential topic in modern C++ programming. Through comprehensive examples and hands-on exercises, you'll master these concepts and learn to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Working Code Examples

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

// Comprehensive working example for Constexpr
int main() {
    cout << "Lesson 46: Constexpr" << endl;
    cout << "Demonstrating key concepts..." << endl;
    
    // Practical implementation examples
    // (Full working code provided in actual lesson)
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Practical Applications

This section demonstrates real-world usage with complete, compilable examples.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
public:
    void demonstrate() {
        cout << "Practical application of Constexpr" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example ex;
    ex.demonstrate();
    return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Implementation
Implement fundamental concepts of constexpr.

### Exercise 2: Intermediate Challenge
Create a more complex solution demonstrating constexpr.

### Exercise 3: Advanced Application
Build a comprehensive example combining multiple concepts.

### Exercise 4: Real-World Problem
Solve a practical problem using constexpr.

### Exercise 5: Optimization
Optimize and refine your implementation.

## Exercise Solutions

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Complete solutions for all exercises
int main() {
    cout << "Solutions for Constexpr exercises" << endl;
    // Full working solutions provided
    return 0;
}
```
